  <h1>The Solar System</h1>
  <h3>The solar system is a collection of celestial objects bound by gravity, with the Sun at its 
    center. It includes eight planets: four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), 
    which are rocky, and four outer planets—two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and two ice giants 
    (Uranus and Neptune). Many planets have moons, with Earth having one, while Jupiter has over 70.
    In addition to the planets, the solar system contains dwarf planets like Pluto, Ceres, Haumea, 
    Makemake, and Eris, which are similar to planets but don't meet all the criteria to be 
    classified as such. The Asteroid Belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, is home to rocky 
    objects, while comets, which originate in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, are icy bodies
    that develop tails as they approach the Sun. The Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud are regions 
    beyond Neptune filled with icy objects and dwarf planets, with the Oort Cloud being the 
    more distant and speculative region containing potential comets.</h3>

    <h3>At the center lies the Sun, around which these celestial bodies orbit. The largest, <b>Jupiter</b>, is 
    a gas giant known for its Great Red Spot, while <b>Saturn</b> dazzles with its magnificent rings. 
    <b>Uranus</b> and <b>Neptune</b>, the ice giants, lie in the outermost reaches, shrouded in mystery. 
    Closer to the Sun, <b>Earth</b>, our home, thrives with life, while <b>Venus</b>, its twin in size, remains a 
    scorching world of thick clouds. <b>Mars</b>, the red planet, teases us with the possibility of past water, 
    and tiny <b>Mercury</b>, the smallest of them all, endures extreme temperatures due to its proximity to 
    the Sun. Together, these eight planets create a fascinating journey through space, each offering a glimpse 
    into the wonders of the universe.</h3>

  <h2>Here’s a list of the planets in our solar system ordered by size, from largest to smallest:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> <b>Jupiter</b> – 139,820 km in diameter</li>
    <li> <b>Saturn</b> – 116,460 km</li>
    <li> <b>Uranus</b> – 50,724 km</li>
    <li> <b>Neptune</b> – 49,244 km</li>
    <li> <b>Earth</b>– 12,742 km</li>
    <li> <b>Venus</b> – 12,104 km</li>
    <li> <b>Mars</b> – 6,779 km</li>
    <li> <b>Mercury</b> – 4,880 km</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Natural satellites, or moons, are celestial bodies that orbit planets. Here’s a look at the moons 
    of each planet in our solar system:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> <b>Mercury</b>: Mercury has no moons. Its proximity to the Sun means it’s unlikely to capture one due to gravitational influences.

    <li> <b>Venus</b>: Venus also has no moons, possibly for the same reason as Mercury.

    </li>

    <li> <b>Earth</b>: Earth has one moon, commonly called "the Moon," which is the fifth-largest moon in the solar system and the largest relative to its parent planet.

    <li> <b>Mars</b>: Mars has two small moons, <b>Phobos</b> and <b>Deimos</b>, which are irregularly shaped and thought to be captured asteroids.

    <li> <b>Jupiter</b>: Jupiter has 79 known moons, with the four largest <b>—Io, Europa, Ganymede</b>, and <b>Callisto</b>—known as the <b>Galilean moons</b>, discovered by Galileo. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system.

    <li> <b>Saturn</b>: Saturn has 83 known moons, with the largest being <b>Titan</b>, which is the second-largest moon in the solar system and has a thick atmosphere. Other notable moons include <b>Rhea</b>, <b>Enceladus</b>, and <b>Mimas</b>.

    <li> <b>Uranus</b>: Uranus has 27 known moons, with the five largest being <b>Miranda</b>, <b>Ariel</b>, <b>Umbriel</b>, <b>Titania</b>, and <b>Oberon</b>. These moons are named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.

    <li> <b>Neptune</b>: Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest being <b>Triton</b>, which is unique because it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction (retrograde orbit), suggesting it might be a captured object from the Kuiper Belt.
